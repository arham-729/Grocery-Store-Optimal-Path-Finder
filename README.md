# Grocery Store Optimal Path Finder

This project aims to find the optimal path for shopping in a grocery store. It assists shoppers in navigating the store efficiently and saving time. The program uses a map of the store layout and a list of items to determine the shortest path to collect all the items.

## Features

- Input the store map and item locations.
- Enter your shopping list.
- Calculate the shortest path to collect all items.
- Generate the optimal route for your shopping.

## Usage

1. Provide the store map in a text file (`map.txt`).
2. Enter the list of items you want to buy.
3. Run the program to find the optimal shopping path.

## How It Works

The program uses a graph-based approach, including algorithms like Kruskal's algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree and graph traversal to calculate the shortest path. It also considers the store layout and item positions.

## Installation

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Compile and run the code in your preferred C compiler.
